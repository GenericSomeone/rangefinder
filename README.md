# TODO

Remove dependency on UI Lib

# INSTRUCTIONS

Click the arrow at the top left to enable the rangefinder. The rangefinder will display the distance from the player to the cursor in tiles.

For some reason, the rangefinder doesn't work up close for units.

Mod requires DeltaNedas/ui-lib to run. ~~I'm 90% sure there's a better way to do this, but I made this mod in 20 minutes~~

# CREDITS

DeltaNedas for making ui-lib and speed (which I used to figure out how this thing is supposed to work)
