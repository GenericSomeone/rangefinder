# INSTRUCTIONS

Click the arrow at the top left to enable the rangefinder. The rangefinder will display the distance from the player to the cursor in tiles.

For some reason, the rangefinder doesn't work up close for units.

Mod uses ui-lib code, but does not require any dependencies to run. ~~I'm 90% sure there's a better way to do this, but I made this mod in 20 minutes~~
